# SQL Case Study 3 - Advanced SQL Queries and Procedures

##  Overview
This project covers a variety of advanced SQL concepts using a sample database containing `Continent`, `Customer`, and `Transaction` tables. The queries demonstrate key SQL features like joins, aggregations, stored procedures, triggers, functions, and error handling.

##  Features & Highlights
- Joins between multiple tables.
- Aggregation functions (SUM, COUNT, AVG, MIN, MAX).
- Stored Procedures for inserting records, fetching data based on parameters.
- User Defined Functions (UDF) for performing calculations and retrieving table-valued data.
- TRY...CATCH blocks for error handling.
- Triggers to:
  - Prevent table deletion.
  - Audit data changes.
- Pivot tables to display aggregated transaction data.

##  Technologies Used
- Microsoft SQL Server (T-SQL)

##  How to Run
1. Create a database named `Functions`.
2. Execute the SQL file sequentially in an SQL Server environment (e.g., SSMS).

## ðŸ“Œ Notes
